                            Internet provides a global open infrastructure for exchanging and
                            sharing of various resources for the people all over the world. The
                            rapid development and the wide application of Internet make it become
                            a new mainstream platform for software to be used, developed, deployed
                            and executed. With the vision of “Internet as computer”, many
                            application styles such as pervasive computing, grid computing,
                            service computing and cloud computing occur on this open and dynamic
                            environment. In order to support various new application styles and
                            accommodate the fundamental change of the underlying supporting
                            platform, many specific software technologies such as service-oriented
                            architecture are proposed for current practices. However, although
                            these technologies are useful and popular, they are far from
                            systematic and complete because no uniformed software methodology and
                            technology system like the object-oriented one is provided.</p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            Conceptually speaking, in order to adapt the software system to such a
                            new environment, its structure model should be autonomous,
                            cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, trustworthy, etc. The
                            software entities dispersed on distributed nodes over the Internet,
                            which evolved from objects in object-oriented methodology to software
                            components (component-based software development), now are further
                            turned into self-contained, autonomous and adaptive software services
                            in service-oriented computing of state-of-arts. These software
                            entities are coordinated statically and dynamically in various kinds
                            of interaction styles (passively and actively) such as integration,
                            cooperation, and orchestration to achieve flexible design objectives.
                            So a so-called “software-web” instead of information-web is weaved.
                            This software-web as a whole is able to perceive the changes of open,
                            dynamic, and uncertain environment and respond them in the way of
                            transforming architectures. Furthermore, the flexible design objective
                            of the software-web is reflected by its exhibiting several compatible
                            goal-directed behaviors according to its up-to-date knowledge about
                            the outside environment. A portmanteau term “Internetware” is used to
                            denote the future software-web in open and dynamic environment, which
                            can be defined as follows: an Internetware system is a software system
                            consists of the self-contained, autonomous entities situated in the
                            distributed nodes of Internet and the coordinators connecting these
                            entities statically and dynamically in various kinds of interaction
                            styles (passively and actively). As a whole, an Internetware system is
                            able to perceive the changes of open and dynamic environment such as
                            Internet, respond to the changes in the way of architectural
                            transformation, and exhibit context-aware, adaptive and trustworthy
                            behaviors in the open and dynamic environment in order to meet its
                            flexible design objectives. Internetware challenges many aspects of
                            software technologies, from operating platforms, programming models,
                            to engineering approaches, etc.<br>
