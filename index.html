                        <h3>Welcome to Internetware 2019</h3>
                        <p>Internet provides a global open infrastructure for exchanging and sharing of various resources for the
                        people all over the world. The rapid development and the wide application of Internet make it become a new
                        mainstream platform for software to be used, developed, deployed and executed. With the vision of
                        “Internet as computer”, many application styles such as pervasive computing, grid computing, service
                        computing and cloud computing occur on this open and dynamic environment. In order to support various new
                        application styles and accommodate the fundamental change of the underlying supporting platform, many
                        specific software technologies such as service-oriented architecture are proposed for current practices.
                        However, although these technologies are useful and popular, they are far from systematic and complete
                        because no uniformed software methodology and technology system like the object-oriented one is
                        provided.</p>
                        <p>Conceptually speaking, in order to adapt the software system to such a new environment, its structure
                        model should be autonomous, cooperative, situational, evolvable, emergent, trustworthy, etc. The software
                        entities dispersed on distributed nodes over the Internet, which evolved from objects in object-oriented
                        methodology to software components (component-based software development), now are further turned into
                        self-contained, autonomous and adaptive software services in service-oriented computing of state-of-arts.
                        These software entities are coordinated statically and dynamically in various kinds of interaction styles
                        (passively and actively) such as integration, cooperation, and orchestration to achieve flexible design
                        objectives. So a so-called “software-web” instead of information-web is weaved. This software-web as a
                        whole is able to perceive the changes of open, dynamic, and uncertain environment and respond them in the
                        way of transforming architectures. Furthermore, the flexible design objective of the software-web is
                        reflected by its exhibiting several compatible goal-directed behaviors according to its up-to-date
                        knowledge about the outside environment. A portmanteau term “Internetware” is used to denote the future
                        software-web in open and dynamic environment, which can be defined as follows: an Internetware system is a
                        software system consists of the self-contained, autonomous entities situated in the distributed nodes of
                        Internet and the coordinators connecting these entities statically and dynamically in various kinds of
                        interaction styles (passively and actively). As a whole, an Internetware system is able to perceive the
                        changes of open and dynamic environment such as Internet, respond to the changes in the way of
                        architectural transformation, and exhibit context-aware, adaptive and trustworthy behaviors in the open and
                        dynamic environment in order to meet its flexible design objectives. Internetware challenges many aspects
                        of software technologies, from operating platforms, programming models, to engineering approaches, etc.

                        <p>With the Internetware paradigm, the software is architected like the Internet, developed with the
                        Internet, operated on the Internet, and provided as services via the Internet. In the open, dynamic, and
                        constantly changing environment of Internet, Internetware systems need to be autonomous, cooperative,
                        situational, evolvable, emergent, and trustworthy. These requirements pose special challenges for software
                        technologies to support the construction, deployment, and use of software applications based on Internet
                        that not only of computers, but also of things and human users.</p>

							<h4>Abstract</h4>
							<p>Smart mobility systems, which include Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and smart energy systems, become more and more important. There is, however, lack of systematical platform studies. This talk introduces a sustainable information infrastructure project for smart mobility systems. The project pursues issues that establish an information infrastructure architecture and seamless development method chain for it. The project has mainly two features: 1) applying life-cycle-oriented methods, which are a cycle from system development to operations, to the real world, and 2) dealing with uncertainties when a system begins to be designed. This talk describes an overview of the project.</p>
							
							<h4>Biography</h4>
							<p>
							Prof. Akira Fukuda received the BEng, MEng, and PhD degrees in computer science and communication engineering from Kyushu University, Japan, in 1977, 1979, and 1985, respectively. From 1977 to 1981, he worked for the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, where he engaged in research on performance evaluation of computer systems and the queueing theory. From 1981 to 1991 and from 1991 to 1993, he worked for the Department of Information Systems and the Department of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Kyushu University, Japan, respectively. In 1994, he joined Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan, as a professor. Since 2001, 2008, and 2016, he has been a professor of Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, and director of System LSI Research Center, and director of R&D Center for Smart Mobility, Kyushu University, Japan, respectively. Since 2015, he has been a distinguished professor of Kyushu University. His research interests include embedded systems, ubiquitous computing, system software (operating systems, compiler, and run-time systems), parallel and distributed systems, and performance evaluation. He is an IPSJ fellow. He is a member of the ACM, the IEEE Computer Society, the IEICE, the IPSJ, and the Operations Research Society of Japan.

							<h4>Abstract</h4>
							<p>Deep neural networks can be regarded as "universally" applicable programs, which build upon not logic but data and optimization. While they are incredibly powerful, they suffer many of the same problems of software systems, e.g., bugs, and back-doors. Recently, there is a trend on applying software engineering techniques to AI systems. In this talk, I will present two such attempts from our group and, more importantly, ask the question on whether such approaches are always justified.</p>
							
							<h4>Biography</h4>
							<p>SUN, Jun is currently an associate professor at Singapore Management University (SMU). He received Bachelor and PhD degrees in computing science from National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2002 and 2006. In 2007, he received the prestigious LEE KUAN YEW postdoctoral fellowship. He has been a faculty member since 2010 and was a visiting scholar at MIT from 2011-2012. Jun's research interests include software engineering, cyber-security and formal methods. He is the co-founder of the PAT model checker. He serves a technical consultant/scientist for multiple companies.
