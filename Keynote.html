                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify">Internetware was proposed as a new software paradigm for the Internet computing in 2001 by researchers from Peking University, Nanjing University, and Chinese Academy of Science. This talk will briefly retrospect the basic philosophy and research framework of Internetware in the first decade, report the in-market practice and great success on big data in the second decade, and explore the open challenges and opportunities of  "Software-Defined" social-cyber-physical systems from the perspective of Internetware.</p>

                         <p align="justify"><strong>Prof. Gang Huang</strong> received both his Bachelor and Masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 1997 and 2000 respectively, and Doctorate degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2003. He has been working at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science in Peking University as a lecture (till 2005), an associate professor (till 2011), a full professor (till 2017) and a tenured full professor (from 2018). His research is on operating system and middleware for internet computing including cloud computing, mobile computing, big data and blockchain. His research outputs were transferred to many open source and commercial software products and widely used in the past decade, such as PKUAS and YanCloud. He won the award of National Outstanding Dissertations in 2006, 2nd Class National Award for Technology Invention in 2008, 2nd Class National Award for Natural Science in 2012, China Youth Science and Technology Award and CCF Distinguished Young Scientists in 2013, 1st Class MOE Award for Science and Technology Progress in 2015, Extra Class CIE Award for Technology Invention in 2017 and NSFC Distinguished Young Scientists in 2017. </p>

                        <p><strong>Cyber-security: the Journey from Formal Methods, Program Analysis, Data Analytics to Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify">Cyber-security is a complex system research, which requires the knowledge across all layers of the computer architecture. In this talk, I would like to share our attempts to solve security problems using various techniques. Starting from formal methods, we have applied formal modeling and reasoning to security designs and implementations on the topics related to security protocols, virtualization systems and Android apps. These efforts lead to our recent research project "Securify: A Compositional Approach of Building Security Verified System", which aims at building secure and verifiable systems ground-up. Security verification and building attack-free systems are very challenging tasks in the view of the size and the complexity of the systems. To solve the scalability problem, we start to explore various program analysis techniques to enhance the state-of-the-art malware and vulnerability detection, which generates encouraging results in Javascript/Android malware and binary vulnerabilities hunting. Along the way, we have collected sizable malware/vulnerabilities samples, which are further used to improving security analysis, understand the security trend, attack attribution/correlation and eventually provide high-level intelligence. Lastly, we will share some very recent works on security analysis for Artificial Intelligence and beyond.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>Dr. Yang Liu</strong> graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in the National University of Singapore (NUS). In 2010, he obtained his PhD and started his post doctoral work in NUS, MIT and SUTD. In 2011, Dr. Liu is awarded the Temasek Research Fellowship at NUS to be the Principal Investigator in the area of Cyber Security. In 2012 fall, he joined Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as a Nanyang Assistant Professor. He is currently an associate professor and the director of the cybersecurity lab in NTU.</br>
                        Dr. Liu specializes in software verification, security and software engineering. His research has bridged the gap between the theory and practical usage of formal methods and program analysis to evaluate the design and implementation of software for high assurance and security. His work led to the development of a state-of-the-art model checker, Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT). By now, he has more than 200 publications and 6 best paper awards in top tier conferences and journals. With more than 20 million Singapore dollar funding support, he is leading a large research team working on the state-of-the-art software engineering and cybersecurity problems.</p>
